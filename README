IRC bot in PHP

You need php5-cli, php5-curl and php5-sqlite (only for the database plugin)

Configure it in config.php (there is a template in config.example.php)
Then run bot.php [config-file.php]

To get a list of commands run grep -R '^\s*\.' plugins

Based on turl's code https://github.com/turl
